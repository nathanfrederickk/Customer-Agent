# Temporary Graduate Visa (subclass 485)
## Post-Higher Education Work stream
This visa is for international students who have recently graduated with a degree from an Australian institution. It allows you to live, work and study in Australia temporarily.

#### How long can you stay?
This is a temporary visa. The length of your stay in Australia will depend on the level of your Australian study qualification.
* Bachelor degree (including honours): 2 years
* Masters (coursework and extended): 2 years
* Masters (research): 3 years
* Doctoral degree: 3 years

The default Graduate Diploma stay period is 2 years, but may be longer where previous study would have attracted a longer stay period.

#### Cost
From AUD2,300.00

#### With this visa, you can:
* Stay in Australia for between 2 to 3 years after you have finished your studies.
* Travel, work or study in Australia during your stay.

Note: You must find your own employment while on this visa.

#### Eligibility Requirements
You must:
* Be aged 35 years or under when you apply. (Exceptions apply)
* Be in Australia when you apply for this visa.
* Hold an eligible visa.
* Have held a Student visa in the last 6 months.
* Have a recent degree in a CRICOS-registered course.
* Provide evidence of adequate health insurance for all applicants when you apply.
* Provide evidence you have applied for an Australian Federal Police check when you apply.

#### Australian Study Requirement Overview
When applying for the Temporary Graduate visa (subclass 485), to meet the study requirement you must have completed either:
* A single eligible qualification that requires at least 2 academic years study, or
* More than 1 qualification that results in a total of at least 2 academic years study resulting in an eligible qualification.

You must have completed your study in Australia, in a total of no less than 16 calendar months, while you held a visa authorising you to study. Your course, or courses, must have instruction completed in English and be registered on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).

#### Course Requirements
Each qualification you have completed and are relying on to meet this requirement must:
* Be either a bachelor's degree or higher, a diploma, an advanced diploma, or a trade qualification.
* Have been undertaken at an Australian educational institution in Australia.
* Have been taught in English.
* Be registered on CRICOS.
* Have been undertaken while you held a visa authorising you to study.

Note: You cannot use English language proficiency courses or enabling programs to meet the study requirement.

#### The 2 Academic Years Study Requirement
Two academic years of study equals 92 weeks that contribute towards 1 or more acceptable qualifications. This is based on the duration of the course as registered by CRICOS.
* You can take longer to complete your course, but you will only be credited with the standard duration registered by CRICOS.
* Only successfully completed study counts towards the 2 academic years. You cannot include failed subjects.

#### Credits and Exemptions
Credit for prior learning may reduce the amount of study undertaken.
* Example: If your course is CRICOS-registered for 3 years (138 weeks) and has 24 units, you complete 2 academic years after successfully completing 16 units. You can use study credits of up to 8 units.
* You cannot count credited units if they were used for another 485 visa, were from a non-CRICOS course in Australia, or were from study completed overseas.
* Your academic transcript must clearly show how credits contribute to your qualification.

#### Minimum of 16 Months Study in Australia
The study requirement cannot be met in less than 16 calendar months of study physically in Australia. This period starts from the commencement of lectures.

* If study credits shorten your physical study time in Australia to less than 16 months, you may not meet the requirement.
* Options if this happens: Have the university cancel the credits and complete the subjects, or complete extra elective units that the university accepts for the qualification.

#### Overlap of Qualifications
You can undertake overlapping qualifications. Where qualifications overlap, the period of study cannot be counted more than once.

#### Study Outside Australia
You can still meet the study requirement if your course included study overseas, provided you complete at least 2 academic years of study (in no less than 16 months) physically in Australia in a CRICOS-registered course.

##### Evidence to Attach to Your Application
* Certified copy of the completion letter from your education provider showing:
    * Start and end dates of the course.
    * Any distance learning components.
    * Location of the campus.
    * Full-time or part-time study mode.
    * Language of instruction.
    * Statement of any credits applied.
* Certified copies of course transcripts.

#### Completion Date
Applications must be made within 6 months of the course completion date. The completion date is when you first met the academic requirements and were notified in writing, not the date of your graduation ceremony.
